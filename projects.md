## Layered Testbench in SystemVerilog
**Date:**  
Jan 2022 to May 2022  

**Summary:**  
A layered testbench based on simplified UVM principles for the OpenCores I2C Multiple Bus Controller with its Wishbone Interface. Constrained random and directed tests are used in verification. This testbench verifies certain features of the specification such as multi-bus functionality, clock stretching, multi-master arbitration, multi-master clock synchronization. Partial testing is also conducted on internal registers and state machines.

## Linux Desktop Environment
**Date:**  
Mar 2021 to Present  

**Summary:**  
Created a portable Linux Desktop Environment which can run on any system using Podman (a daemonless Docker alternative). The environment runs on Arch Linux and uses XMonad as its desktop environment. Personal data for this environment is managed using a private git-annex repository and stored on multiple physical remotes and a S3 bucket hosted by AWS. Each remote has chunking enabled and is encrypted with PGP.

## Feedhorn Antenna
**Date:**  
Aug 2021 to May 2022  

**Summary:**  
Worked with a team of 4 other electrical/computer engineering students and NAVAIR personnel to develop a feedhorn antenna capable of replacing a discontinued part in an existing system. My role consisted of modeling the antenna using Fusion360, simulating prototypes using Ansys Electronics Desktop (HFSS), and antenna characterization.

## Convolutional Layer
**Date:**  
Aug 2021 to Dec 2021  

**Summary:**  
Designed a convolutional layer for use in Binary Neural Networks using the ideas described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00363. The design was coded using Verilog, verified using SystemVerilog, and synthesized using Synopsys Design Compiler.

## Non-Neural Object Detection System
**Date:**  
Mar 2021 to Dec 2021  

**Summary:**  
An implementation of the Viola-Jones object detection algorithm built from scratch using Rust.

## Nuclear Probe
**Date:**  
Aug 2019 to Dec 2019  

**Summary:**  
Worked with a team of 4 other engineering students, from differing disciplines, to create a probe capable of calculating the power output of NC State's nuclear reactor by measuring Cherenkov Radiation. My role consisted of designing the electronics, modeling the system in Fusion360, and developing the code to analyze and present the data using MATLAB.
